""" This script partitions data for a given directory into the appropriate sized sets
    The input is given via the command line as a string that is the path to the directory that has the data that needs
    to be partitioned.

    It will look at the total number of photos that we have and partition them based on a fixed percentage (perhaps
    unless one is given via the command line).
